## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- 📘 Practicing DSA daily using Java and LeetCode.
- 📂 Uploading clean, well-commented Java solutions to GitHub.
- 📚 Strengthening my programming logic and problem-solving skills.

---

## 🌱 I’m preparing to learn next:
- 🛢️ Complete SQL and relational database design.
- 📊 Data visualization using Tableau.
- 📐 Statistics & Probability for data analysis.
- 🤖 Machine Learning and basic ML model building using Python.

---

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Beginner-friendly DSA or data science projects.
- Mini projects that apply real-world data and visualizations.
- College-level or student-led open-source initiatives.

---

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Building a structured path from DSA to Data Science.
- Applying ML models on real datasets.
- Choosing beginner-friendly datasets for practice.

---

## 💬 Ask me about:
- How I stay consistent with daily coding.
- How I’m organizing my learning path toward Data Science.
- My experience in solving LeetCode problems with Java.
